## Summary
This project explores how UX design can address persistent barriers to mental health access for Asian Americans, including cultural stigma, language differences, and the shortage of culturally informed providers. Grounded in national health data and human-centered research, the project proposes a culturally aware therapist-matching platform that prioritizes language accessibility, values alignment, and trust-building UX patterns. Rather than treating Asian Americans as a monolith, the design emphasizes flexible filtering, personalization, and low-stigma onboarding to support users across generations, immigration backgrounds, and levels of familiarity with therapy.

### Skills Used
- UX research and human-centered design
- Literature review and data synthesis
- Competitive and comparative analysis
- Persona development and empathy mapping
- User journey mapping
- Accessibility-focused UX design
- Multilingual and ESL-aware interface design
- Low- and high-fidelity prototyping
- Ethical and inclusive design practices
- Figma (wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes)

### Outcomes and Impact
- Synthesized national datasets (SAMHSA, ACS, APA) to identify structural inequities in mental health access for Asian Americans
- Identified a clear utilization gap: Asian Americans represent ~6% of the U.S. population but only ~1.5–1.7% of mental health service recipients
- Conducted a competitive audit of four mental health platforms, uncovering major gaps in cultural filtering, language accessibility, and multigenerational usability
- Designed a therapist-matching flow that supports filtering by language fluency, cultural background, and values alignment rather than ethnicity alone
- Developed personas and journeys representing diverse generational and immigration experiences, including youth, caregivers, and first-generation users
- Produced low- and high-fidelity prototypes that demonstrate multilingual support, plain-language UX copy, and trust-centered onboarding
  
### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
This was an individual project.

**My Role:**  
I independently led the end-to-end design process, including research synthesis, problem definition, persona creation, journey mapping, and prototyping. I conducted competitive analysis, translated quantitative health data into actionable design insights, and designed all wireframes and high-fidelity mockups in Figma. I also made key UX decisions around accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and ethical representation to ensure the platform addressed stigma, language barriers, and trust concerns within Asian American communities.

### Reflection
This project reinforced how deeply access to care is shaped by culture, language, and trust—not just availability. Working with national health data made clear that underutilization of mental health services among Asian Americans is not a matter of need, but of systemic and experiential barriers. Designing for this space required resisting one-size-fits-all solutions and instead creating flexible, values-aware UX patterns that respect diversity within the community. The process strengthened my ability to translate structural inequities into concrete design priorities, balance inclusivity with ethical risk management, and approach sensitive health contexts with both rigor and care.
