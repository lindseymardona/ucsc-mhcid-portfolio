## Summary
The Latino Climate & Health Dashboard is a first-of-its-kind public data resource that makes localized climate and health disparities visible across California’s Latino majority neighborhoods. Hosted at latinoclimatehealth.org, the dashboard presents interactive county-level factsheets comparing extreme heat, air pollution, and health outcome indicators between Latino neighborhoods and non-Latino white neighborhoods. The site equips community advocates, policymakers, and public health stakeholders with reliable, actionable data to support equitable policy and planning decisions.

As the UX Designer, I led the design of the dashboard interface, the informational flow of the website, and the layout of downloadable factsheets — all guided by iterative user feedback from stakeholders and advisory partners. My work ensured that complex environmental and health statistics were communicated clearly, accessibly, and effectively for diverse users, from grassroots advocates to legislative staff.

### Skills Used
- Stakeholder engagement & survey feedback integration
- UX research & user flow design
- Dashboard UI/UX design
- Information hierarchy & layout for factsheets
- Responsive design for public audiences
- Iterative prototyping and usability refinement
- Figma for high-fidelity visual and interactive mockups
- Cross-team collaboration with research and policy partners

### Outcomes and Impact
- Designed an intuitive user flow that guides visitors from high-level climate and health insights to county-specific factsheets and resource pages
- Conducted stakeholder surveys and feedback sessions with partners at UCLA LATINO Policy & Politics Institute to refine taxonomy, labeling, and navigation priorities based on real user needs
- Iterated interfaces to ensure clarity, accessibility, and actionable presentation of complex data — balancing technical accuracy with community usability
- Helped translate research outputs into a public tool that supports awareness, civic engagement, and equitable policy planning around climate risks and health inequities
- Contributed to a high-impact resource that now informs environmental justice advocacy, public health communication, and regional planning efforts across California
  
### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Institute researchers, California Wellness Project partners, advisory committee members representing climate justice, public health, and data equity organizations.

**My Role:**  
I served as UX Designer and contractor responsible for the dashboard’s user experience, information architecture, interface design, and document layout. I structured the site’s navigation and user flow, designed its core UI components and responsive layouts, and translated stakeholder research into clearer content presentation. I also developed the visual templates for factsheets and guided iterative refinements based on stakeholder survey feedback.

### Reflection
Working on the Latino Climate & Health Dashboard highlighted the power of UX design as a bridge between research and public impact. This project required balancing data complexity with community accessibility — making technical environmental health data usable for advocates, policymakers, and residents alike. By grounding design decisions in stakeholder feedback and iterative testing, I strengthened my ability to create interfaces that honor both clarity and equity. The work deepened my practice in designing for public interest data platforms where human-centered design and social justice meet — and underscored how good UX can amplify the reach and usefulness of critical civic information.
