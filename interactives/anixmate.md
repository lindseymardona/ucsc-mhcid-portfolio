## Summary
This project is a swipe-based anime recommendation web app inspired by dating app interaction patterns. Designed during Hack at UCI, the project explores how familiar left/right swipe mechanics can lower the barrier to anime discovery while keeping the experience lightweight, playful, and accessible. Users are presented with anime recommendations and can quickly express interest or skip, creating a personalized discovery flow.

As the sole UX designer on the team, I led the entire design effort — from interaction patterns and accessibility considerations to branding and visual identity — enabling the engineering team to focus on implementation planning and system logic.

### Skills Used
- UX and interaction design for recommendation systems
- Accessibility-first UI design (ADA contrast considerations)
- Design system creation under time constraints
- Rapid prototyping for hackathon workflows
- Visual branding and logo design
- Cross-functional collaboration with engineers

### Outcomes and Impact
- Built a reusable design system in Figma, including typography, color tokens, buttons, and cards with accessibility and contrast in mind
- Ensured ADA-aware color contrast across UI elements to support readability and inclusivity
- Created the logo and visual branding, establishing a cohesive identity across screens
- Delivered a fully interactive web prototype that communicated product intent clearly to engineering teammates and hackathon judges### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
- Simon Lee — Engineering
- Alex Espejo — Engineering
- James San — Engineering
- Lindsey Mardona — UX Design

**My Role:**  
I served as the sole UX and visual designer, responsible for interaction design, accessibility considerations, design system creation, branding, and prototyping. I translated a loosely defined idea into a cohesive, testable product concept and ensured the interface was both usable and visually consistent under tight time constraints.

### Reflection
This project demonstrated the importance of strong UX foundations in fast-paced, engineering-heavy environments. Designing anixmate reinforced my ability to quickly establish accessible design systems, make decisive product choices, and communicate clearly through prototypes when UX resources are limited. It also strengthened my confidence in advocating for accessibility and visual clarity—even in hackathon settings where speed often takes priority over design rigor.
