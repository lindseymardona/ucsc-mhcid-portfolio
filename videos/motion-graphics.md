## Summary
This body of work showcases my motion graphics and multimedia design practice within music-driven projects. I primarily create animated visuals for song covers and music videos, often in projects where I also perform vocals, handle vocal editing (tuning and timing), oversee the mix, and direct the overall creative vision. My motion graphics work focuses on translating sound, emotion, and narrative into visual rhythm—using movement, typography, and composition to support musical storytelling rather than distract from it.

While many projects are self-directed, I also participate in larger collaborative works where I take on a creative lead role. In those cases, I help define visual direction, coordinate contributors, and ensure cohesion across audio and visual elements, even when I am not the primary animator.

### Skills Used
- Motion graphics and animation
- Audio–visual synchronization
- Visual storytelling and mood design
- Typography and compositing for video
- Creative direction and project oversight
- Vocal production (tuning, timing, comping)
- Cross-disciplinary multimedia workflows

### Outcomes and Impact
- Produced multiple music video and cover visualizations that integrate animation with vocal performance and sound design
- Developed a consistent audio-visual workflow, aligning motion timing with musical phrasing, dynamics, and emotional beats
- Led end-to-end creative production on solo projects, from performance to final animated output
- Contributed visual direction and coordination on larger collaborative projects, supporting cohesive final releases
- Built a versatile multimedia skill set bridging music, animation, and narrative design
  
### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
Varies by project — solo works and small to mid-scale collaborations.

**My Role:**  
Depending on the project, I serve as the motion graphics designer, vocalist, editor, and creative director. For solo works, I lead the entire pipeline from performance and audio production to final animation. For collaborative projects, I focus on creative direction, auditory and visual cohesion, and supporting the overall multimedia vision.

### Reflection
Motion graphics has been a core creative outlet for exploring how sound and movement interact. Working across music, animation, and production has sharpened my sensitivity to timing, rhythm, and emotional pacing—skills that translate directly into interaction design, data storytelling, and user experience work. This practice reinforces my ability to think systemically about narrative, balance technical execution with expression, and lead creative projects across disciplines.
