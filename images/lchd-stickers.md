## Summary
As part of the Latino Climate & Health Dashboard project, I designed a set of visual sticker assets intended to support outreach, community engagement, and project identity. The goal was to create graphics that were culturally resonant, visually approachable, and aligned with the dashboard’s mission of communicating climate and health inequities to diverse audiences.

The design process followed a rapid, stakeholder-driven workflow: I produced initial sketch concepts, incorporated partner feedback to identify preferred directions, and refined selected designs into polished, production-ready visuals.

### Skills Used
- Concept sketching and visual exploration
- Iterative design based on stakeholder selection
- Brand alignment across digital and physical media

### Outcomes and Impact
- Produced multiple initial sketch concepts to explore tone, symbolism, and accessibility
- Collaborated with stakeholders to select and refine preferred designs
- Delivered final, high-resolution sticker assets aligned with LCHD branding and messaging
- Created visuals that support community outreach, visibility, and project recognition
- Extended the dashboard’s visual identity beyond the website into physical and shareable formats
  
### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Institute, California Wellness Project

**My Role:**  
I independently sketched, refined, and finalized all sticker designs. I translated stakeholder preferences into cohesive visual assets while ensuring alignment with the project’s tone, accessibility goals, and broader visual system.

### Reflection
This work reinforced the importance of lightweight, iterative design in public interest projects. Even small visual assets can play a meaningful role in trust-building and community engagement when they are developed collaboratively and grounded in stakeholder feedback. Designing these stickers strengthened my ability to move quickly from concept to polished deliverables while maintaining clarity, cultural sensitivity, and visual consistency.
