## Summary
This project investigates how sentiment and emotional complexity are associated with geographic places in Holocaust survivor testimonies. Using nearly 1,000 English-language oral history transcripts from the Shoah Foundation, the study combines manual annotation, natural language processing, and geospatial analysis to examine how affect varies across narrative time and location. Rather than reducing places to fixed emotional meanings, the project critically evaluates the limits of computational sentiment analysis when applied to historically and ethically complex material, showing how survivor memories of places such as camps, refugee sites, and postwar destinations contain layered and sometimes contradictory emotions.

### Skills Used
- Digital humanities research design
- Qualitative close reading and ethical annotation
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Manual sentiment annotation and dataset construction
- Python (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn)
- Transformer models (GPT-2 fine-tuning; GPT-3 prompt engineering)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) and geocoding
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Comparative model evaluation
- Data visualization and spatial analysis

### Outcomes and Impact
- Manually annotated 864 testimony segments to create a domain-sensitive sentiment dataset
- Evaluated multiple sentiment analysis approaches (VADER, TextBlob, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, GPT-2, GPT-3), demonstrating the limitations of dictionary-based and linear models for Holocaust testimonies
- Fine-tuned a GPT-2 transformer model, achieving substantially improved accuracy over baseline methods without incurring high computational costs
- Extracted and geocoded 144,000+ place entities from survivor testimonies and linked them to predicted sentiment contexts
- Produced visualizations showing how sentiment shifts across narrative time and how emotional experiences were geographically dispersed before, during, and after World War II
- Contributed a critical digital humanities case study that foregrounds ethical concerns and methodological constraints in computational analyses of trauma narratives

### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
This was an individual project.

**My Role:**  
I independently conceptualized, designed, and developed *Gingko*, a mobile app aimed at helping Asian Americans find culturally sensitive mental health support. My work included conducting user research, defining the problem space, designing user flows, creating wireframes and high-fidelity mockups, and building interactive prototypes in Figma. I also made key product and UX decisions to ensure the app addressed cultural nuance, accessibility, and user trust.


### Reflection
This project highlighted both the promise and the ethical challenges of applying computational methods to survivor testimony. While transformer-based models significantly outperformed traditional sentiment analysis techniques, the research underscored that sentiment in Holocaust testimonies is often ambiguous, multidimensional, and resistant to categorical classification. Through manual annotation and close reading, I became acutely aware of how emotional meaning depends on historical context, narrative framing, and human interpretation. This work strengthened my ability to critically evaluate digital tools, balance quantitative analysis with humanistic inquiry, and design research workflows that respect the complexity of lived experience rather than oversimplifying it.
