## Summary
This project is a UX redesign project focused on improving the usability, aesthetics, and feature clarity of the Ultimate Guitar website — a long-standing online resource for guitar tabs, chords, and music learning. Through structured heuristic evaluation, field research, prototyping, and iterative design, this project identifies core usability issues in the existing platform and proposes a revitalized, user-centered interface flow that simplifies navigation, improves task efficiency, and fosters a more inviting experience for both novice and experienced musicians.

### Skills Used
- UX evaluation (heuristic analysis & competitive comparison)
- Usability testing & pilot study design
- Contextual inquiry & task analysis
- Persona and empathy map creation
- User journey mapping
- Wireframing & interaction flow modeling
- Interface design systems and style refinement
- High-fidelity prototyping
- Peer review and cognitive walkthrough

### Outcomes and Impact
- **Heuristic Evaluation:** Identified key usability gaps in visibility of system status, navigation clarity, feedback mechanisms, and error prevention based on established heuristics.
- **Pilot Usability Test:** Designed a moderated test script and survey, conducted early usability testing with real tasks, and uncovered pain points in difficulty ratings, tab exploration, and unclear interface elements.
- **Contextual Inquiry:** Gathered observational insights that revealed confusion with ads, redundant navigation flows, and missed opportunities for helpful content, driving early design decisions.
- **Persona & Usage Models:** Created detailed personas representing different user types — from novice learners to more technophobic musicians — to inform tailored UI decisions.
- **Prototyping:** Developed both low-fi wireframes and high-fidelity interactive prototypes to validate redesigned workflows, including search, tab filtering, and tutorial access.
- **Interface Design:** Iterated multiple visual design variations with contrast checks and accessibility considerations before finalizing a cohesive color, typography, and layout system.

### Team & Contributions

**Team Members:**  
This was an individual project.

**My Role:**  
I led this project end to end — from early evaluations and research to prototyping and interface execution. My work included designing and conducting heuristic evaluations, contextual inquiries, and usability testing; developing personas and journey maps; and translating findings into wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes (created with Figma). I also prepared presentation materials and delivered a pitch summarizing the rationale and outcomes of the redesign.


### Reflection
This was my first UX project from start to finish. It sharpened my ability to conduct foundational UX evaluations and synthesize research into actionable design decisions. By rigorously applying heuristic principles and observing real user behaviors, I moved beyond aesthetic redesign toward evidence-based problem solving. Integrating both qualitative insights and visual design refinement helped me understand how interface patterns shape learning and task success — especially in platforms with diverse user motivations and varying levels of tech fluency. I also learned how prototype fidelity and peer feedback play crucial roles in validating design hypotheses before implementation.
